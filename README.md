## Description:
Online / Offline Budget tracker with graph. Users are able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. 
When entering transactions offline, they populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries are added to tracker.

## Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even <strong>more</strong> important. 
Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

## About the Project:
This app is part of the curriculum for the U of A / Trilogy Education Services Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

## DEMO:

### Screenshots:

## Technologies:
JavaScript, MongoDB/Mongoose, Morgan, Node.js/Express, lite-server, compression

## Future / Scalability:
I hope to add tracking for categories of spending, goals, savings, and further refine the UI.
Possibly addition of an API for a stock and crypto scroller.
